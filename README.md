# Binary-Multiplication

I build using Linked List in C an algorithm that will multiply binary numbers and returns the result in binary. The program wants to 
choose decimal or binary input from user, then when the user entered input, the algorithm puts binary equivalent of input into Linked List 
and it makes multiplication operations step by step. So, we can multiply too big numbers.
